title: Trained a word2vec (word embeddings model) model for Bahasa and Singlish !
---

In this post Iâ€™m going to show how the word2vec (word embeddings model) encapsulates and delivers the contextual information without using any prior knowledge. I first encountered word2vec back in 2013 and had written a white paper for finding word similarities using a different type of neural network (http://www.neuramatix.com/NeuraBASE%20for%20Finding%20Word%20Similarities.pdf).
